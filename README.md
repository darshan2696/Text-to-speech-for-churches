# Text-to-speech-for-churches
Guy with the second wave of covid hitting us, we all struggle to run our church services. I'm making this tool to help with Bible reading when you cannot invite anyone to church. 

All you need to do is specify which bible reading it is and whats the reference, my code can find the verse and talk the according to which bible reading it is.

sample output:
Possible inputs ===> (1,2,responsive,gospal)
type of reading? 1
please give the ref                acts 6:8-9
The first lesson is taken from the book of acts, chapter 6, verses 8 to 9. The book of acts, chapter 6, verses 8 to 9. And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people. Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen. Here ends The first lesson , praise be to thee, O'christ.
